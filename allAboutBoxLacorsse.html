          "Box lacrosse, also known as boxla, box, or indoor lacrosse, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America.
           The game originated in Canada in the 1930s, where it is more popular than field lacrosse and is the national summer sport.
           Box lacrosse is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice
           hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing
           field of field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an
           effort to score by shooting a solid rubber lacrosse ball into the opponent's goal. The highest level of box lacrosse
           is the National Lacrosse League.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are 62 total members of World Lacrosse, only fifteen have competed in international box lacrosse competition.
          Only Canada, the Iroquois Nationals and the United States have finished in the top three places at the World Indoor Lacrosse
          Championships."

          "The National Lacrosse League (NLL) is a men's professional box lacrosse league in North America. Headquartered
          in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the NLL currently has thirteen teams: eight in the United States and five in
          Canada.[1] The NLL ranks third in average attendance for pro indoor sports worldwide, behind only the NHL and
          NBA.[2] Unlike other box lacrosse leagues which play in the summer, the NLL plays its games in the winter and
          spring, from December to June. Each year, the playoff teams battle for the National Lacrosse League Cup. The
          NLL has averaged between 8,900 and 10,700 spectators per game each year since 2004.[3][4]"
