      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse">
        <p>
          "Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. It is the oldest organized sport in
          North America, [1] with its origins in a tribal game played by the indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands and
          by various other indigenous peoples of North America.[2] The game was extensively modified reducing the violence
          by European colonizers to create its current collegiate and professional form.[3]
        </p>
        <p>
          The modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations
          bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations.[4] The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men,
          the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse
          Championships for both men and women.[5] Each is held every four years.[5] Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been
          contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908.[6][7][8] It was also held as a demonstration
          event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics.[9][10]
        </p>
        <p>
          Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has
          four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box
          lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports
          and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads.[11] The women's game is played
          outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.[12] The only protective gear required
          for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact
          sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.[13]"

        <p>
          "Major League Lacrosse (MLL) is a men's field lacrosse league consisting of six active teams in the United States.
          The league's inaugural season was in 2001, making MLL the oldest professional field lacrosse league in North America.
          [1] Teams have played anywhere from ten to 16 games in a summertime regular season, with a four-team playoff for the
          championship trophy, the Steinfeld Trophy, named after founder Jake Steinfeld. League attendance peaked at 6,417 in
          2011[2] and the 2019 average was 4,587.
        </p>
        <p>
          The league is made up of the Chesapeake Bayhawks and New York Lizards (originally the Baltimore Bayhawks and Long
          Island Lizards), who competed in the first three championship games, with the Lizards winning two. The Philadelphia
          Barrage returned to the league in 2020 after an 11-seven hiatus. After moving from Bridgeport to Philadelphia, the
          Barrage won three championships in four years from 2004 to 2007. The Boston Cannons, the last of the six charter
          franchises to remain in its original market with its original name, won its first championship in 2011. For much
          of the league's history, the Denver Outlaws have been the only team west of the Mississippi River, being part
          of the league's ambitious westward expansion in 2006. Being owned by the Pat Bowlen family and the Denver Broncos,
          the Outlaws have been successful from the start, missing the postseason only once in 14 seasons, while claiming
          three championships in nine appearances. The Connecticut Hammerheads are the league's truly youngest franchise,
          and were set to play at Rafferty Stadium near Bridgeport in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic forced a
          shortened, quarantined season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current champion is the Boston Cannons, who defeated the Denver Outlaws at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium
          in Annapolis, Maryland following a COVID-19-shortened 2020 season."

          "College lacrosse is played by student-athletes at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.
          In both countries, men's field lacrosse and women's lacrosse are played at both the varsity and club levels.
          College lacrosse in Canada is sponsored by the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association (CUFLA) and
          Maritime University Field Lacrosse League (MUFLL), while in the United States, varsity men's and women's
          lacrosse is governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Junior College Athletic
          Association (NJCAA) and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). There are also university
          lacrosse programs in the United Kingdom sponsored by British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) and programs
          in Japan.[1]
        </p>
        <p>
          In the U.S., as of the 2019–20 academic year, there were 74 NCAA-sanctioned Division I men's lacrosse teams, 75
          Division II men's lacrosse teams, and 248 Division III men's lacrosse teams. There are 117 Division I women's
          lacrosse teams, 114 Division II women's lacrosse teams, and 293 Division III women's lacrosse teams. There were
          also 21 men's programs and 11 women's programs at two-year community colleges organized by the National Junior
          College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and a growing number of National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
          (NAIA) four-year small college programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 2016–17, there were 184 collegiate men's club teams competing through the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse
          Association (MCLA), including most major universities in the United States without NCAA men's programs,
          organized into two divisions and ten conferences. Schools that feature an NCAA Division I FBS football team
          must play in Division 1, while most other teams compete in Division 2. There are 225 collegiate club teams
          for women organized by the Women's Collegiate Lacrosse Associates (WCLA)."
